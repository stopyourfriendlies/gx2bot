### SETUP



## Imports

# import discord.py libraries to interact with Discord
import discord
from discord.ext import commands, tasks

import gspread

# import stuff to download images so we can post them to Discord
import aiohttp
import io

## Logging

logger = logging.getLogger('TO')  # set up a log called 'TO'
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)  # set Logging Level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to only show info level and up

# output log to file
handler = logging.FileHandler(filename='TOCommands.log', encoding='utf-8', mode='w')
handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s:%(levelname)s:%(name)s: %(message)s'))  # change this if you want log items formatted differently
logger.addHandler(handler)



## Google Sheets setup

# set credentials to use on the google sheet
gc = gspread.service_account(filename='credentials.json')

# Open a sheet from a spreadsheet in one go
gx2_discord_members_spreadsheet = gc.open(os.getenv('SHEET_DISCORD_MEMBERS'))
